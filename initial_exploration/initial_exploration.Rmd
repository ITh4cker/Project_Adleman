Getting the data
```{r}
#file1Meta <- read.table(file = "./data/0A32eTdBKayjCWhZqDOQ.asm", sep=" ")
file1Binary <- read.table(file = "./data/0A32eTdBKayjCWhZqDOQ.bytes", header = F)

     
     
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
